An android mobile application to create a means for travelers to find convenient parking spaces located in the top visited cities in USA. This app provides useful information to help the travelers find a spot quick and easy. We build the app using REST, SQLite, Java and Google Maps and Places API. The three main functions that will be utilized for the application would include the nearest parking lots, based on current position, available rates for the user's date and price point, and the max available spots per lot.
